              While I was born in Ames, IA, Iâ€™ve lived most of my life in Omaha, NE. I have an eye for creative approaches to issues as well as a curiosity towards how things are built digitally. With a background equal parts design and development, I can deliver thorough design solutions to clients. 
            <br /><br />
            Whenever I am neither designing nor developing, I can be found strength training at the gym, watching movies with probably too much focus, or slowly, slowly working on a game I am developing.
